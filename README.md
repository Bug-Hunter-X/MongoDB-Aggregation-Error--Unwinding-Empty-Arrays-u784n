# MongoDB Aggregation Error: Handling Empty Arrays in $unwind
This example demonstrates a common error in MongoDB aggregation pipelines: using the `$unwind` operator without handling cases where the array to unwind is empty.  This can lead to unexpected errors or pipeline failures.  The solution shows how to gracefully handle these scenarios using `$ifNull` or conditional aggregation stages.

## Bug
The provided JavaScript code shows an aggregation pipeline that attempts to join two collections and then unwind the results.  However, if a document in the primary collection lacks any corresponding entries in the secondary collection, the `$unwind` stage will cause an error.

## Solution
The solution uses `$ifNull` to provide a default value when the array is empty, preventing the `$unwind` stage from failing.
